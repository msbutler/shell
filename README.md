# Setup on a new host
`git clone https://github.com/msbutler/shell.git ~/.shell && ~/.shell/setup.sh`

A poor man's https://github.com/dt/shell

Other parts of setup to note:
- use iterm2
- in iterm, configure infinite scrollback, natural text editor, block cursor
  (more natural for vim).
- in non-insert mode, change the iterm font color to black to make the
  highlighted characters clearer.

Good Tools to Install
- ag:  quick file search
